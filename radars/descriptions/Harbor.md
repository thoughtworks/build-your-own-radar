[Harbor](https://goharbor.io) is an open source registry that secures artifacts with policies and role-based access control, ensures images are scanned and free from vulnerabilities, and signs images as trusted. As a CNCF Graduated project, Harbor delivers compliance, performance, and interoperability to help you consistently and securely manage artifacts across cloud native compute platforms like Kubernetes and Docker. 

### Pros
* Built in security scanning through [Clair]()
* CNCF incubating
* Active community
* Integrated web ui
