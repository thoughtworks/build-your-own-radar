S3 is a distributed file system. It is highly scalable and has many uses. Recommended usages are diverse. One such scenario: it is the recommended WNE technology for data lakes including two types of zones:
1. Raw (such as a copy of operational data stores or as the history of operational events)
2. Curated/gold (post cleanse and transform)

Since S3 is a file system, there are many choices for data format. Structured formats include parquet (recommended) and ORC. Semi-structured formats include JSON (recommend JSON per line), XML, and CSV. Unstructured formats include media files such as audio and video.

Related to above, we see it being used as the source of master data (entities) and as the underlying source of analytical data (with replication to serving databases potentially outside S3).

### Pros
* Cost effective storage (keep in mind that there are multiple tiers selected based on data access frequency and latency requirements)
* High scale
* Reasonable latency

### Cons
* Without oversight it’s easy to accumulate data that does not have value
